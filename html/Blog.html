      <h1> West Coast NBA Fans </h1>
    </div>
    <div class = "blogtext">
      <p> "West Coast NBA fans". A term long synonymous with "Laker fans", it has recently become a two team tango with the rise of the Warriors, while Kings, Clippers, Blazers, Jazz, and Suns fans wait on the sidelines. <br> <br>

	The sheer number of Warriors and Lakers fans make the opinions of West Coast fans resemble that of those fanbases, and the impact of their respective franchises only increases this effect. The Warriors dominate airwaves as perhaps the most dominant dynasty in history, while sporting two of the most recognizable megastars in the game. Their acquisition of Kevin Durant added a helping of controversy to their otherwise clean image of a franchise built "the right way." Whether you're discussing the game itself, or the personalities surrounding it, the Warriors are the top topic. Meanwhile, the Lakers' 16 championships have helped them maintain their luster through the worst era in franchise history. They're still shown on national TV an obscene amount relative to the quality of their rosters, and still hover over every franchise with an impending free agent like a specter (whether or not those situations makes any sense. Looking at you here LeBron rumors). <br> <br>

	As a result, it should be no surprise that any question remotely related to either of the franchises was weighed in their favor. West Coast NBA Fans (WCF from now on), were 113% more likely than the typical fan to believe the 1999-00 Los Angeles Lakers were the best team all time, and likely influenced by the Kobe Bryant/Laker fan contingent, WCF were 93% more likely to believe LeBron James is not a top 16 player of all-time. WCF are 61% more likely to believe that small markets have far too much power," which makes sense when you realize the Lakers and Warriors play in 2nd and 6th largest media markets in the US, respectively. With likely the superest of “superteams” in Golden State, it's no surprise that WCF are 49% more likely to be "Always Supportive" of superstars joining up and creating such teams. <br> <br>

	Given the NBA's embrace of a more free-flowing, jump-shooting oriented style (reminiscent of the stereotypical West Coast playstyle), it makes sense that WCF are 36% more likely to support the NBA going further in that direction. It makes even more sense when considering the Warriors are the poster team for that style change, with the Suns also being willing adopters. <br> <br>

	The smaller West Coast fanbases might finally have shined through when answering the question of whether the league interferes inappropriately with games/the draft. The most notorious victim of possible interference was the 2002 Sacramento Kings, and even though the Lakers were their opponent and benefactors, WCF as a whole were still 36% more likely to believe the league interfered. It's also entirely possible that the Warriors contingent was the culprit again, given several controversial league decisions and refereed games in their previous 2 Finals appearances.
